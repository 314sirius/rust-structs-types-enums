# Rust Structs, Types, and Enums

_Rust Bootcamp week 3: Structs, Types, and Enums_

This week, you will learn how to create structs, types, and enums as well defining new types and extending them. You will use types like `String` and manipulate other data structures like vectors and hash maps. `Enum`s in Rust are similar to `enum`s in other languages, but they have some interesting features that make them more powerful like the `Option` and `Result` types that can be used to handle errors with `match` expressions.

## Contents
This week has several examples located in the [./examples](./examples) directory. Make sure you have Rust installed and you are using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-alfredodeza).

This repository is *Codespaces ready*, and it is set as a template repository. You can create a new repository from this template and start working on your own with Codespaces. This means that Rust, Copilot, and all the extensions are already installed and configured for you.
